# Retrieval Augmented Generation with FlanT5, Langchain, BM25, and TF-IDF

## Overview

This project explores the combination of various retrieval and generation techniques to enhance natural language understanding and generation. The primary components include Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using FlanT5, Langchain, and traditional information retrieval methods such as BM25 and TF-IDF.

## Features

- **FlanT5:** Leveraging FlanT5 for retrieval augmented generation, a state-of-the-art model that combines T5 with retrieval mechanisms.
- **Langchain:** Integrating Langchain, a powerful language model, to further enhance natural language understanding and generation.
- **BM25:** Using BM25, a classic probabilistic information retrieval model, for efficient document retrieval based on keyword matching.
- **TF-IDF:** Employing TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for document similarity and relevance scoring.
